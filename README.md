# EstimateX

This application 'EstimateX' is developed as a part of my SC205 - Discrete Mathematics Application Project. (Winter 2020 - DAIICT)

This is my first android application based on machine learning and discrete mathematics.


USAGE:

--->This is a completely offline application, used to estimate any quantity that is based on any number of parameters, provided a dataset (training set).

--->Application contains an easy to interpret 'Application Manual' that will help the user how to use all the efficiency of the application.

--->User has to provide a dataset to the application following all the norms given in the manual.

--->On executing the estimation, the machine will use linear regression and matrices to work on the dataset and generate a hypothesis(formula) that is based on the given parameters.

--->If all the required parameters for an estimation are provided in the same sequence used in the training set, then the application can also use the obatined hypothesis to
    estimate the desired quantity for the given parameters.
    
--->If the estimation is only based on a single parameter then the user can also plot the training set as well as the hypothesis on a cartesian plane using 'Plot Hypothesis' button.

ADVANTAGES:

--->This application can work for any training set containing any number of training examples that are based on any number of parameters.

--->It is not necessary that the desired value should only depend on the parameters linearly, it can depend on any parameter with any degree. User will still get the correct
    hypothesis.

--->User can also set the power of estimation (degree of the hypothesis) manually to get the best possible result of estimation.

--->The application is programmed to generate hypothesis which is a complete polynomial of any number of provided parameters and any value of degree (power of estimation).


I hope the PDF files in the repo will help you to know more and in detail about the application.
